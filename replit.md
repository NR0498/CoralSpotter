# Coral Reef Detection & Classification System

## Overview

This is a computer vision application that combines YOLO object detection with deep learning classification to identify and classify coral reef lifeforms in underwater images. The system uses Streamlit for the web interface, YOLO for coral detection, and TensorFlow/Keras for coral species classification.

## User Preferences

- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Interface requirements**: Dark mode interface (implemented)
- **Dataset requirements**: Separate datasets for YOLO detection and coral classification with real images
- **Training requirements**: Proper YOLO model training with robust implementation
- **Visualization requirements**: Enhanced bounding boxes and overlays on test images
- **Functionality requirements**: Image upload capability to expand training datasets
- **Deployment requirements**: Ready for production deployment

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application
- **Layout**: Wide layout with sidebar for model management
- **Session State**: Maintains inference engine across user sessions
- **File Upload**: Supports image upload with real-time processing

### Backend Architecture
- **Detection Engine**: YOLO (Ultralytics) for coral object detection
- **Classification Engine**: TensorFlow/Keras CNN for coral species classification
- **Inference Pipeline**: Combined detection + classification workflow
- **Model Management**: Separate training modules for each model type

### Computer Vision Pipeline
1. **Image Preprocessing**: OpenCV-based image handling and resizing
2. **Object Detection**: YOLO model identifies coral regions in images
3. **Classification**: TensorFlow model classifies detected coral types
4. **Visualization**: Bounding box overlay with confidence scores and labels

## Key Components

### Core Models
- **YOLOTrainer** (`models/yolo_trainer.py`): Handles YOLO model training for coral detection
- **CoralClassifier** (`models/coral_classifier.py`): Manages TensorFlow model for coral species classification
- **CoralDetectionInference** (`models/inference.py`): Unified inference engine combining both models

### Utilities
- **DataPreprocessor** (`utils/data_preprocessing.py`): Image validation, resizing, and dataset preparation
- **ImageUtils** (`utils/image_utils.py`): PIL/OpenCV image format conversions and utilities
- **VisualizationUtils** (`utils/visualization.py`): Detection result visualization with bounding boxes

### Main Application
- **app.py**: Streamlit interface with model loading, training controls, and image processing

## Data Flow

1. **Training Phase**:
   - Images stored in `data/images/train` and `data/images/val`
   - YOLO labels in `data/labels/train` and `data/labels/val`
   - Coral type images in `data/coral_types/{species_name}/`

2. **Inference Phase**:
   - User uploads image through Streamlit interface
   - Image preprocessed using ImageUtils
   - YOLO model detects coral regions
   - Classification model identifies coral species for each detection
   - Results visualized with bounding boxes and labels

3. **Model Storage**:
   - Trained models saved in `trained_models/` directory
   - YOLO model: `coral_yolo.pt`
   - Classification model: `coral_classifier.h5`
   - Label mapping: `coral_labels.json`

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and computer vision
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: Object detection framework
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning for classification
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image manipulation

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Streamlit development server for testing
- Models trained locally with GPU support (if available)
- File-based storage for images and models

### Production Considerations
- Models and training data stored in persistent volumes
- GPU acceleration recommended for training phases
- Web interface can run on CPU for inference
- Consider model versioning for production deployments

### Data Requirements
- Minimum 30 training images for YOLO model
- Annotated bounding boxes in YOLO format (.txt files)
- Organized coral species images for classification training
- Validation splits automatically handled by training modules

## Architecture Decisions

### Model Choice Rationale
- **YOLO for Detection**: Fast, accurate object detection suitable for real-time inference
- **CNN for Classification**: TensorFlow provides robust classification capabilities with good Streamlit integration
- **Two-Stage Pipeline**: Separates detection and classification for modularity and easier debugging

### Data Management
- **File-based Storage**: Simple deployment without database requirements
- **Structured Directories**: Clear separation between training/validation data and different data types
- **JSON Label Mapping**: Human-readable label storage for easy debugging

### Framework Selection
- **Streamlit**: Rapid prototyping with minimal web development overhead
- **OpenCV**: Industry standard for computer vision preprocessing
- **Modular Design**: Separate training and inference components for maintainability
